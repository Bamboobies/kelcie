Last week, the FBI, led by Agent Hannah Montana—yes, *that* Hannah Montana—stormed your desert camp like it was a bad reality TV reboot. They nabbed your Silverado, pups and all, after you refused to unlock its secret stash of contraband freedom flags. 'No cage can hold us!' you bellowed, escaping with Athena into the night.
